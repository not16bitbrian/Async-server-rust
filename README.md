# System Programming - Asynchronous Web Server

This project is a system programming project implemented in Rust. It is an asynchronous web server that combines several principles covered in the Rustlings book.

## Description

The asynchronous web server is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests and provide responses asynchronously. It utilizes Rust's asynchronous programming capabilities to achieve high concurrency and performance.

## Features

- Asynchronous handling of HTTP requests and responses.
- Efficient utilization of system resources.
- Concurrency and parallelism using Rust's async/await syntax and executor.
- Integration of various concepts and principles covered in the Rustlings book.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git`
2. Install Rust programming language (if not already installed): [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Build the project: `cargo build`
4. Run the web server: `cargo run`
5. Access the server at `http://localhost:8000` or the specified port.

## Dependencies

This project may rely on the following dependencies:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Other Rust crates or libraries, as specified in the project's `Cargo.toml` file.
